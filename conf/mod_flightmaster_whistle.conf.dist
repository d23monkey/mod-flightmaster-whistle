# Mod Flightmaster Whistle configuration
########################################
#
#    Flightmaster.Whistle.Enable
#        Description: Enable/disable the module
#        Default:     0 - Disabled
#                     1 - Enabled
#

Flightmaster.Whistle.Enable = 1

#
#    Flightmaster.Whistle.Timer
#        Description: Players will be able to teleport to nearest flight master every Flightmaster.Whistle.Timer seconds
#        Default: 900 - can use the command once every 15 minutes
#

Flightmaster.Whistle.Timer = 900

#
#    Flightmaster.Whistle.Preserve.Zone
#        Description: If 1, the nearest flightmaster is always searched in the same zone as the player's. For example, if the
#                     player is in Barrens, the nearest flightmaster is searched only in Barrens. If 0, the nearest flightmaster
#                     is searched globally (still limited to continent though). So this means that if the player is in northern
#                     Barrens, the nearest flightmaster will be found in Ashenvale.
#        Default: 1 - zone is preserved when searching
#

Flightmaster.Whistle.Preserve.Zone = 1

#
#    Flightmaster.Whistle.LinkMainCities
#        Description: Link main cities to their respective zones (ex. Orgrimmar to Durotar). If this is 1, then players in Durotar
#                     can be teleported to the flight master in Orgrimmar.
#        Default: 0
#

Flightmaster.Whistle.LinkMainCities = 0

#
#    Flightmaster.Whistle.MinPlayerLevel
#        Description: Minimum player level required to use the Flightmaster Whistle
#        Default: 1
